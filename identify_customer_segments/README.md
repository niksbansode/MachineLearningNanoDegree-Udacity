# Identify Customer Segments for a mail-order sales company in Germany.

## Unsupervised Learning  

For this project, Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest was to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 
I have used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then used those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I have also assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

The following libraries have been used in this project:
* NumPy
* pandas
* Sklearn / scikit-learn
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Seaborn (for data visualization)
